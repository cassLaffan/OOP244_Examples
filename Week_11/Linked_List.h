* Today, we'll be creating a data structure

* A linked list is, in essence, a data structure
* (a class) which has two data members. Whatever its
* "data" is (int, Student, float, whatever!) and a pointer
* to the next "node" in said linked list.

* To accomplish this, we will be creating a "Node"
* template class.
