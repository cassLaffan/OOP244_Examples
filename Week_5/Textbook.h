/*
* This week, we are going to write a textbook class that inherits from
* the book class. We will contrast and compare how it works with the Manga class.

* You'll need these member variables for textbook: subject, institution, and a 
* dynamnic list of courses which require it. Furthermore, getters and setters
* are always necessary!
